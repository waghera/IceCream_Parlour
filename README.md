# IceCream_Parlour
JAVA OOP

Suppose there is an ice-cream parlour named Enchanted and having a branch in Islamabad and other in Rawalpindi. Both these branches offer same flavour of ice-cream
(vanilla, strawberry, and mango) but Rawalpindi branch does not offer dine-in facility (only take-away). The Islamabad branch has recently established its franchise 
in COMSATS university Islamabad. For marketing purpose, the COMSATS’ branch is offering its all-unique Enchanted flavours with a mix of chocolate in it. 

  The owner of the ice-cream parlour wants a computerized system of order placing and keeping record of daily total orders in all the branches. You have to develop a menu-driven application in which a person can order a maximum of 3 cups at a time. Write a test code for Islamabad main branch for single person, Rawalpindi branch for two persons, and COMSATS university Islamabad branch for three persons and return a total number of ice-cream cups sold in a day.
  
Hint:
    Each ice-cream cup contains a single scoop of only one flavour. Date, time, branch name and ice-cream flavour should be a common variant of all scenarios. Set 
dine-in/takeaway to be true or false for every order. For placing the order, number of scoops/flavours depicts number of cups ordered. The orders placed in COMSATS 
university Islamabad must have chocolate mix without customer’s request. 

Example: Placeorder (Mango, Strawberry) should print “Order placed for mango and strawberry flavour”
